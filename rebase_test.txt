initial on dev
# I will create a new branch rebase_test from dev and commit some modifications(in this file) on local.
# After, I will create a new branch other from dev, push some modifications(in this file) and merge to dev.
# Now dev is ahead of rebase_test, I can test how to move commits on dev to rebase_test.

# This is others' modifications.

# Now other guy modify this file again.
This is rebase_test branch.


# You can use 'git rebase dev' on rebase_test branch to auto-merge and solve confilicts between others' and your's.
# Now normally, rebase_test modified by you is ahead of dev.

# There are more modifications commited by other developer, now you should rebase again.

# rebase will commit-wise compare your modifications and others', don't be afraid, you can re-add and re-commit each time when there have confilicts.
